Onboarding
-----------
Congratulations! You are now officially a member of an awesome team ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž

Before starting the serious works, let's walk you through an introduction, some interesting reads and a few tutorials to get you prepared ðŸ˜‰


Who are we and what do we do?
==============================
<For Zen, our blogger, to write>

Following are the projects that our team is currently working on:

- `The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire <https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/>`_

- `NeuroKit2: The Python Toolbox for Neurophysiological Signal Processing <https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit>`_

- `Psychological Determinants of the Susceptibility to Fake News amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic <https://osf.io/79uvk/>`_

- The Process Model of Lying and Deception: The Study of Mental and Physiological Process of Deception

Get connected
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

We believe that the best way to start this journey is to get out there, listen to the ongoing discourses and get publicly engaged. And `Twitter <https://twitter.com/home>`_ might be the very platform to do it ðŸ˜‰
We have compiled a `list of interesting accounts <https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding/blob/master/Connect.rst>`_ for you to start following. Make a **pull request** to add on to the list your favorite accounts! 

Wondering what is a **pull request**? Continue to read one!


Get familiar with the tools
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Python
+++++
We mostly use Python for signal processing and setting up experimental tasks. For instance, the `NeuroKit2 <https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit>`_ project that we are working on is written in Python. 
We also build our experiemntal tasks using `Neuropsydia.py <https://github.com/neuropsychology/Neuropsydia.py>`_ which is also a Python module. 

Therefore, it's important that you get familiar with the tool. Following are a few resources that we suggest to get you started: 

- `Get familiar with Python in 10 minutes <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/learn_python.html>`_

R
++
The bulk of our statistical analyses and manuscript preparation is done on R. 

At this point, you might ask why can't we just stick to one programming language? What is the point of learning both R and Python? 
The simple answer is that the two programming languages are basically different and one can be more powerful in one task than the other.
This `blog post <https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/r_or_python/>`_ will however give you a much more interesting answer to the above question.\

Following are a few resources to get you started with R:

- `Introduction to R <http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction>`_
