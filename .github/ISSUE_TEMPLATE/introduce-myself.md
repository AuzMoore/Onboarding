So for starters, let's create an issue to introduce yourself! 😄
PS: This is informal and totally for fun so don't feel like you have to write us a CV 😉
You can tell us anything you want about yourself, and these are a few questions to guide you along:

What's your name (or more specifically, what do you want us to call you?) and what are you currently doing (e.g. studying/in a research position etc.)?
What's your favourite food? (@Tam-Pham and I can go for MALA 🌶️ all day everyday; bonus points if you join us and laugh at @DominiqueMakowski for his spice intolerance)
What's your hobby?
What's your go-to place to hang out in Singapore? (Are you like a @DominiqueMakowski who just wants to go drinkdrink party all day 🥳 )
What's your favourite movie? (or genre) and why!
What's your favourite city/country to be travelling around? 🗺️
If you weren't studying/pursuing a career in psychology, what would you be doing? (You can be absolutely creative with this and imagine a world with 0 restrictions)
Go ahead and click on New issue, fill it up and submit!
And there you have it, your first Github issue created and matriculation into our damn cool team 👍
