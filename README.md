# The Survival Guide to working with us

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/neuropsychology/Onboarding?label=last%20update)

**Welcome to the team!** üéâ Whether you're a student, an intern or a colleague, joining a new work environment can be a bit stressful. In order to ease your first days and set you up for the future, we compiled this guide and hope that you will find it useful.

The goal of this guide is first and foremost to help you acquire the same frame of reference, so you can then understand what we are talking about, the issues that we face and the solutions that we find. However, it is possible that some of the advice or things here might at first seem weird or useless. Trust us though, it will become handy some day üòâ

This guide has been crafted by all past and current members of the team. It's our collective legacy, and it will be yours too. As such, by the end of your journey here, we expect you to leave your mark in this document, by updating / improving / revising some of its content. Don't worry, you will see *what* and *how* in due time.

Before starting the serious works, let's walk you through an introduction, some interesting reads and a few tutorials to get prepare you for the ride üòâ


## Questions

> I feel a bit lost

> I'm not sure what I should do and what my tasks are



## Our vision

We care about technical skills and soft skills. Friendly working environment (forget the formalities, ain't nobody got time for that). The **three-fold neuropsychology skill set**: clinical abilities, technical skills, theoretical knowledge.


## Roadmap <sub>(05-06-2020)</sub>

*Note: this roadmap is typically something that has to be updated by the team, it's our collective responsibility. So if you notice that it's outdated, do make a Pull Request (see below if you don't know what it is) to update it!*

Following are the projects that our team is currently working on:

- `The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire <https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/>`_

- `NeuroKit2: The Python Toolbox for Neurophysiological Signal Processing <https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit>`_

- `Psychological Determinants of the Susceptibility to Fake News amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic <https://osf.io/79uvk/>`_

- The Process Model of Lying and Deception: The Study of Mental and Physiological Process of Deception



## Day 1: Enter the world

### Explore your environment

Pay a visit to your colleagues, introduce yourself, explore the building, localize the offices.

### Get the Admin done

Do whatever is required on the admin side, complete the ethical certification, the mandatory trainings, etc. 

### Get connected

- [x] **Twitter**

We believe that the best way to start this journey is to get out there, listen to the ongoing discourses and get publicly engaged. And `Twitter <https://twitter.com/home>`_ might be the very platform to do it üòâ
We have compiled a `list of interesting accounts <https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding/blob/master/Connect.rst>`_ for you to start following. Make a **pull request** to add on to the list your favourite accounts! 

Wondering what is a **pull request**? Continue to read one!


- [x] **GitHub**

- Watch (and star :star:) these repos:
- Create a new issue in this repo (https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding/issues), select the **Introduce myself** template, and answer the questions üòÅ


- [x] **ResearchGate**


### Good reads



#### Papers

#### Books

#### Videos

#### Movies / TV Shows





## Day 2: Get familiar with the workflow



### Github

As you might have already realized by now, our team loves to connect and meet new people (who are cool just like us üòé), and therefore, we are also members of the largest open source community in the world - `Github <https://github.com/open-source>`_.

The fact that one of our very active projects `NeuroKit2 <https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit>`_ is built and maintained on Github, we would love you to get familiar with the platform too. 

Create your Github account (if you don't already have it) and let's get started with the following resources:

- `Github Guides <https://guides.github.com/>`_
- `How to use Github to contribue <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html#how-to-use-github-to-contribute>`_
- `How to create a Pull Request <https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/github-collaboration/how-to-submit-pull-requests-on-github/>`_






## Day 3: Get familiar with the tools


### Python

We mostly use Python for signal processing and setting up experimental tasks. For instance, the `NeuroKit2 <https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit>`_ project that we are working on is written in Python. 
We also build our experiemntal tasks using `Neuropsydia.py <https://github.com/neuropsychology/Neuropsydia.py>`_ which is also a Python module. 

Therefore, it's important that you get familiar with the tool. Following are a few resources that we suggest to get you started: 

- `Get familiar with Python in 10 minutes <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/learn_python.html>`_

### R

The bulk of our statistical analyses and manuscript preparation is done on R. 

At this point, you might ask why can't we just stick to one programming language? What is the point of learning both R and Python? 
The simple answer is that the two programming languages are basically different and one can be more powerful in one task than the other.
This `blog post <https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/r_or_python/>`_ will however give you a much more interesting answer to the above question.\

Following are a few resources to get you started with R:
