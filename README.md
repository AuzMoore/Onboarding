# The Survival Guide to working with us

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/neuropsychology/Onboarding?label=last%20update)

**Welcome to the team!** üéâ Whether you're a student, an intern or a colleague, joining a new work environment can be a bit stressful. In order to ease your first days and set you up for the future, we compiled this guide and hope that you will find it useful.

The goal of this guide is first and foremost to help you acquire the same frame of reference, so you can then understand what we are talking about, the issues that we face and the solutions that we find. However, it is possible that some of the advice or things here might at first seem weird or useless. Trust us though, it will become handy some day üòâ

This guide has been crafted by all past and current members of the team. It's our collective legacy, and it will be yours too. As such, by the end of your journey here, we expect you to leave your mark in this document, by updating / improving / revising some of its content. Don't worry, you will see *what* and *how* in due time.


## Questions

> I feel a bit lost

Send us a message, we're likely unaware of that! 

> I'm not sure what I should do and what my tasks are

Send us a message, we're likely unaware of that! 

> There's too much work for me

Send us a message, we're likely unaware of that! 

> There's not enough work for me

Send us a message, we're likely unaware of that! 

## Our vision

Our team in centred around core values such as **teamwork**, constant **learning**, **friendly** environment and **aiming for the top**.

We rely on a lot of internal communication (about stuff more or less related to work), our ability to always learn and improve, a cool working environment (forget the formalities, ain't nobody got time for that) and striving for the highest standards in terms of sciencific quality and honesty. We're committed to **open-science**, i.e., working open by sharing our code, documentation, data (where possible) and expertise.

On a more abstract level, I believe in what I call the **three-fold neuropsychology skill set**. I think that a neuropsychologist should aim at developping 3 types of expertise: clinical abilities, technical skills and theoretical knowledge.


## Roadmap <sub>(05-06-2020)</sub>

*Note: this roadmap is typically something that has to be updated by the team, it's our collective responsibility. So if you notice that it's outdated, do make a Pull Request (see below if you don't know what it is) to update it!*

Here are the projects that our team is currently working on:

- [The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire](https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/)

- [NeuroKit2: The Python Toolbox for Neurophysiological Signal Processing](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit)

- [Psychological Determinants of the Susceptibility to Fake News amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://osf.io/79uvk/)

- The Process Model of Lying and Deception: The Study of Mental and Physiological Process of Deception



## üìÜ Day 1: Enter the world

### 1. Explore your environment

Pay a visit to your colleagues, introduce yourself, explore the building, localize the offices, find the toilets and the coffee machine.

### 2. Get the Admin done

Do whatever is required on the admin side, complete the ethical certification, the mandatory trainings, etc. 

### 3. Get connected

- [x] üê¶ **Twitter** 

We believe that the best way to start this journey is to get out there, listen to the ongoing discourses and get publicly engaged. And [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) might be the very platform to do it üòâ It's great for the research arena because researchers can recruit participants for experiments and easily share and summarize their findings in threads, so you can keep up with the latest scientific news here. If you don't believe us, check-out this [**book about Twitter for researchers**](https://t4scientists.com/).

We have compiled a list of interesting accounts for you to start following, covering all sort of different topics (but always relevant). Later, don't forget to make a **pull request** (wondering what is a *pull request*? Continue to read) to add on to the list your favourite accounts!

Open them all in different tabs (`CTRL + Left Click`) and follow them **all** (even if you don't see any reason for it *at first*):

At first, you'll like have to force yourself a bit to open and check twitter from time to time (to make it easier, set it as favourite and download the app), but soon it will be filled with interesting content.

- [x] :octocat: **GitHub**

As GitHub claims itself, it *brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software*. Whether you're a beginner to programming or an expert, integrating into this community means you'll be constantly learning. It is a place where projects are shared openly and transparently, and you can simply *watch* any repository you're interested in to receive notifications of relevant updates.

## üìÜ Day 2: Get familiar with the workflow



### Github

As you might have already realized by now, our team loves to connect and meet new people (who are cool just like us üòé), and therefore, we are also members of the largest open source community in the world - [Github](https://github.com/open-source).

The fact that one of our very active projects [NeuroKit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) is built and maintained on Github, we would love you to get familiar with the platform too.

Create your Github account (if you don't already have it) and let's get started with the following resources:

- [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [How to use Github to contribue](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html#how-to-use-github-to-contribute)
- [How to create a Pull Request](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/github-collaboration/how-to-submit-pull-requests-on-github/)

Try it yourself:
- Create a new issue in [this repo](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding/issues), select the [**Introduce myself**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=introduce-myself.md&title=%5BWelcome%21%5D) template, and answer the questions üòÅ
- Create a pull request to add something to the Onboarding repository; you can for example:
  - Fix a typo in this document
  - Add some recommended good movies/reads!

## üìÜ Day 3: Get familiar with the tools


### Python

We mostly use Python for signal processing and setting up experimental tasks. For instance, the [NeuroKit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) project that we are working on is written in Python. 
We also build our experiemntal tasks using [Neuropsydia.py](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Neuropsydia.py) which is also a Python module. 

Therefore, it's important that you get familiar with the tool. Following are a few resources that we suggest to get you started: 

- [R or Python for Psychologists](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/r_or_python/)
- [Get familiar with Python in 10 minutes](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/learn_python.html)

### R

The bulk of our statistical analyses and manuscript preparation is done on R. 

At this point, you might ask why can't we just stick to one programming language? What is the point of learning both R and Python? 
The simple answer is that the two programming languages are basically different and one can be more powerful in one task than the other.
This [blog post](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/r_or_python/) will however give you a much more interesting answer to the above question.\

Following are a few resources to get you started with R:

- [Introduction to R](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction)

# Some Final Words

We encourage you to really explore and be integrated within the online scientific community along with us, as this will help you expand your knowledge and skillset as well as become better informed! It may be a steep learning curve initially, but we're here to help you along the way (we've been there ourselves!) and never hesitate to ask questions üòâ
